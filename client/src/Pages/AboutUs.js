        While still in the process of mastering the MERN stack, I primarily
        concentrated on fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
        throughout this project. It's been a valuable learning experience, and the
        main aim was to develop a user-friendly task management application. I
        sincerely hope you find it beneficial!
